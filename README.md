CS499Assignment3
================

This project contains three folders: PIQLE, Testing, and Part2.


The PIQLE folder is just the source code for the PIQLE library. It's required by our code for parts 3 and 4.

The Testing folder contains our solution for parts 1, 3, and 4. It contains an eclipse project for running jockey. It requires the PIQLE library to compile properly, but Eclipse can't seem to handle relative links when linking external source code, so you will have to update the project's link to the PIQLE folder manually (Since I assume that you won't be testing it from /cshome/tgriffit/c499/CS499Assignment3). If you run the code it will provide a GUI providing all of the possible actions.

The Part2 folder contains our solution for part 2. <ANDREW, ADD THIS!>
